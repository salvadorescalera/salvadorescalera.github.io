                    <p>Overall I recommend this class to any one looking to get into web developing or are just curious of
                            what makes up part of the technology driven era we live in today. It is an excellent course which
                            covers plenty of different areas of the developing community. There is a lot of hands on learning
                            which aids greatly in learning these various tasks.
