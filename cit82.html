                    <p>CIT 82 has been a great experience this semester, I had some expected outcomes but nothing
                            like what we have learned. I expected to learn minor things here and there about web developing
                            or coding more like learning from a book type of way. But this was a breath of fresh air compared
                            to that. Being able to work using the internet for our work was a first for me. Learning to use web
                            searches and reviews created a seamless transition from what we were learning to the work.
